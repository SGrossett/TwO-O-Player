# TwO-O-Player Math Game

A 2-Player math game where players take turns to answer simple math problems. A new math question is generated for each turn by picking two numbers between 1 and 20. The player whose turn it is is prompted the question and must answer correctly or lose a life.

The game doesn’t end until one of the players loses all their lives. At this point, the game should announce who won and what the other player’s score is.
